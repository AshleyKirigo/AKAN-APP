##**DESCRIPTION**
AKAN is a naming system used by GHANIANS to name their children when born.
The names depended solely on the baby's gender and the day of the week they are born.
Since a majority of the people have no clue when they are born what this web application will do is first calculate the day of the week you are born then from the list of names provided, show what your AKAN name is.What the user simply needs to do is fill in the dates of birth as well the gender so as for it to run
